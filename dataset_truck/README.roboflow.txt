The dataset includes 516 images.
Truck are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 24 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -14 and +14 degrees
* Random shear of between -15° to +15° horizontally and -15° to +15° vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -23 and +23 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.64 percent of pixels
